The salt-common and salt-minion deb files here are for the Sheevaplugs (armelv5 architecture).
You'll need to do:

  sudo pip install msgpack-pure
  
in order to get them working correctly!

NOTE: we may have to upgrade the version of ZeroMQ as the old one available in the package manager on the sheevaplugs has known keepalive issues.
